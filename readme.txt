These scripts reproduce the results of the article "Estimating Convergence of Markov chains with L-Lag Couplings", by Niloy Biswas, Pierre E. Jacob and Paul Vanetti. An R Markdown tutorial reproducing the results of the article is available: https://niloyb.github.io/LlagCouplings/

The Polya-Gamma sampler is taken from the package BayesLogit of Nick Polson, James Scott, and Jesse Windle. https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesLogit

Each folder contains README file which explains how to run the scripts corresponding to particular examples in the paper.
