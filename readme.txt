These scripts reproduce the results of the article "Estimating Convergence of Markov chains with L-Lag Couplings", by Niloy Biswas, Pierre E. Jacob and Paul Vanetti. An R Markdown tutorial is available: https://niloyb.github.io/LlagCouplings/

Each folder contains README file which explains how to run the scripts corresponding to particular examples in the paper.

The Polya-Gamma sampler is taken from the package BayesLogit of Nick Polson, James Scott, and Jesse Windle. https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesLogit

The unbiasedmcmc package is based on "Unbiased Markov chain Monte Carlo with couplings", by Pierre E. Jacob, John O'Leary, Yves F. Atchade

The debiasedhmc package is based on "Unbiased Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with couplings", by Jeremy Heng and Pierre E. Jacob.
