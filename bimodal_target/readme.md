### Bimodal target
===============

### These scripts reproduce the Bimodal target example.
That is, a histogram and density of the 500th marginal of a RWMH, 
and meeting times and corresponding TV bounds for targeting 0.5N(-4,1)+0.5N(+4,1)
with a RWMH with step-size 1 and initial distribution N(10,1).

#### bimodal_target.R contains all the functions and generates the data. 
#### bimodal_target_plots.R plots the figure in the paper.
