### Standard normal target
===============

These scripts reproduce the Univariate Normal RWMH example. That is, obtain meeting times for the RWMH sampler with step-size 0.5 targeting N(0,1) and plot the corresponding TV and 1-Wasserstein bounds.

#### standard_normal_RWMH.R both runs the simulations and creates the figures.
